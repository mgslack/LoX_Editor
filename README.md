# LoX Editor
A save game editor for Lords of Xulima

Application opens the LoX saved game file and allows one to edit the XML save game
file.  Will repack during save along with setting the password as necessary.  Use
at your own risk.

In addition to raw XML editing, the editor features an option to edit the saved
characters inside of a edit dialog.  The editable fields are limited to resistances,
attributes and a few other fields.  The dialog is a little safer than raw XML
editing, but still should be used with caution.  BACK UP YOUR SAVES!!!!

Uses DotNetZip, used latest version from:
 https://github.com/haf/DotNetZip.Semverd
Save game editor and DotNetZip compiled with VS 2019.
