    <p>The LoX_Editor allows one to open and edit save games created by Numantian games Lords of Xulima.
       The editor will display the games XML in an edit box that can be updated as needed.  When through,
       can save the updated XML.</p>
    <p>The editor is pretty simple.  Can open a save game, save an edited save game and search for elements
       in the XML file.  The search always starts are the top and will reset to the top if the search text
       is changed.  The search button does a search first/next depending on if the text searching on has
       been searched before or not.  Once the file has been searched, the search will reset back to the top
       if searched one more time.  Suggested strings to look for: "Gold", Gaulen, DevelopmentPoints, your
       characters names, experience.</p>
	<p>Standard mode for the editor is raw XML editing.  The editor also features an 'edit chars' button,
       which will open a dialog that will allow editing of some of the character attributes.  The dialog
       opens with Gaulen, and has 'next' and 'prev' buttons to view/edit the next or previous character.
       The dialog allows one to edit the character name (except for Gaulen), the resistances, attributes,
       HP and MP bonuses, number of times killed, experience and development points.  There are maximum
       values, but are set way high for each field.  Most of these fields can be increased in game by
       various actions and so you'll need to make sure there is the ability to grow naturally versus
       setting values to the uppper maximum.  Generally, you'll not want to edit resistances higher
       than 60, attributes around 60 also.  HP and MP bonus should be left under 500, times killed, under
       100.  Experience is given so you can balance your characters, but should not really be pushed
       above 100000 with the editor.  Development points are capped in the game and anything over 75
       will be lost (game rolls them to zero around 85 or so).  When done editing the characters, select
       the 'save' button.  The XML is rebuilt and displayed with the updated values in the xml text
       box.</p>
    <p>During the save, the XML is checked to make sure it is still well-formed (valid XML syntax) to
       catch 'fat finger' mistakes.  This should catch mistakes in the XML, since editing it raw, that
       were un-intended.  For example, removing a &quot; or an XML tag that is needed.  This will not
       check validity of the XML schema.  This line number in the error message is pretty close, though
       usually indicates the line following the line with the error (it shows where the syntax mistake
       was detected).
    <p>Item editing is only done in raw XML.  The highest quality is 16.  Can edit all items and change the
       quality line to:
       <pre>&lt;Complex name="Quality" type="SOL.ItemQualities.ItemQuality16, SOL" /&gt;</pre>
       Generally, except for one 'talking' chest, you will only find or be able to but items of
       quality 15. In additon, there is only one enchantment that can be added to each item.  Suggestion
       is to copy the complex structure from another item that has the enchantment you want over the
       enchantment (or lack of) structure of the item adding to.  King enchantment gives pluses to all
       attributes.</p>
    <p>Items are added to the bottom of the list of items in the party pack.  To easily find the last
       item(s) collected, search for "Gold", then scroll up to review the last items collected (as
       long as they didn't stack over existing items you have).
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">Game Options:</div>
    <p>There are no real options to set or configure for the LoX editor.  The program does save off
	   the main window position and size when exiting the program and saves the directory last loaded
       a LoX save game from.</p>
