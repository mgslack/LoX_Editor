    <p>The LoX_Editor allows one to open and edit save games created by Numantian games Lords of Xulima.
       The editor will display the games XML in an edit box that can be updated as needed.  When through,
       can save the updated XML.</p>
    <p>The editor is pretty simple.  Can open a save game, save an edited save game and search for elements
       in the XML file.  The search always starts are the top and will reset to the top if the search text
       is changed.  The search button does a search first/next depending on if the text searching on has
       been searched before or not.  Once the file has been searched, the search will reset back to the top
       if searched one more time.  Suggested strings to look for: "Gold", Gaulen, DevelopmentPoints.</p>
	<p>In the future, will have a feature to open up character edit dialogs with common attributes/fields
       to edit for each character rather than just the raw XML save file.</p>
    <div style="font-weight:bold;">Game Options:</div>
    <p>There are no real options to set or configure for the LoX editor.  The program does save off
	   the main window position and size when exiting the program and saves the directory last loaded
       a LoX save game from.</p>
